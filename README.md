# IonicDemo Tutorial

HI Guys,

if you want to play a bit with ionic here is an example to get warm with the Ionic Framework, the UI Elements and the Ionic CLI.

First you have to install ionic with npm install `$ -g @ionic/cli`

For this first experience we use one of the pre-made app templates. We will use the tabs App.
With Â´$ ionic start myApp tabs` and by following the Instructions of the Ionic CLI the App will be created.

You can run the App with `$ ionic serve`. If you use `$ionic serve --lab` you will see your App like it was on a Smartphone. 

Now you can try out a bit and if you want to you can try to build your first app to look like the one I did in this project. I used Cards, an Alert, some Buttons, some of the ionic Icons and a Date & Time Picker. 


In the [Docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/components) you can have a look at all the UI Components.
